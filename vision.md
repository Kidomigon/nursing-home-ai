# Nursing Home AI Platform – Vision

## Core Idea
Per-room AI assistants act as both:
- Private, personalized conversational companions for residents.
- Continuous safety and health sentinels that detect emergencies and concerning patterns.

A central staff portal aggregates only **relevant, actionable signals** from all room assistants without exposing raw conversations, preserving resident privacy and dignity.

## Non-Negotiable Principles
- **Resident-first**: Designed to increase autonomy, comfort, and dignity, not surveillance.
- **Privacy by default**: Raw conversations stay on the room device unless there is clear consent or a narrow emergency override.
- **Staff augmentation, not replacement**: Supports nursing staff and caregivers; does not replace existing nurse call or clinical judgment.
- **Deployable in real facilities**: Must work with unreliable Wi‑Fi, mixed hardware, and busy staff.

## Initial Deployment Target (MVP)
- One small facility or wing.
- Audio-only sensing (no cameras) on dedicated room devices.
- Basic staff dashboard (web/tablet) for alerts and simple per-resident histories.
- Personality and privacy controls configured per resident.

## Key Differentiators
- Per-room AI that is a **companion first, sentinel second**.
- Strong, understandable privacy controls for residents and families.
- Context-aware, trend-based alerts instead of raw sensor streams.
- Designed to integrate into existing workflows and resident portals, not replace them.
