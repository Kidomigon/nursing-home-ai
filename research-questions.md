# Research Questions

## Resident Portals & Facility Workflows
- What features do typical senior living / nursing home resident portals include today?
- How do residents, families, and staff actually use these portals (what gets used vs ignored)?
- How are announcements, schedules, and requests handled today?
- How do portals integrate with nurse call systems and EHR/EMR, if at all?

## Privacy, Consent, and Regulation
- What are common consent models in long-term care for monitoring/assistive tech?
- How is surrogate decision-making (family/guardian) typically handled for residents with impaired capacity?
- What existing privacy frameworks or guidelines apply to AI-based monitoring tools in elder care?
- How do facilities currently communicate monitoring/surveillance to residents and families?

## Safety & Alerting
- What current tools are used for fall detection, wandering alerts, and distress detection?
- What are staff’s main complaints about existing systems (false alarms, complexity, etc.)?
- How do facilities measure success for safety/monitoring tools (fewer incidents, faster response times, staff satisfaction)?

## Personas & Adoption
- What are the key personas in a facility (by role) and what are their top 3 pain points each?
- How do residents feel about voice assistants and always-on devices?
- What objections do administrators have to new monitoring technologies (cost, risk, complexity)?

These questions will guide targeted research so that the product and system design aligns with real-world practice, not just idealized assumptions.
