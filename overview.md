# Room Companion – AI Assistant for Safer, More Human Senior Care

## What It Is

Room Companion is a per-room AI assistant for nursing homes and assisted living. Each resident gets their **own helper device** in their room that:

- Talks with them like a calm, respectful companion.
- Listens for **help calls and distress** (audio-only, like a smart speaker).
- Alerts nurses/CNAs through a simple **staff portal** when something seems wrong.

It is designed to **support staff and protect residents** without turning their room into a surveillance zone.

## Why It Matters

- Residents can feel **lonely, confused, or unsafe** between staff rounds.
- Staff are **busy and stretched thin**; they can’t be in every room.
- Existing tools (call buttons, pendants, cameras) are often:
  - Hard for residents to use in the moment.
  - Too noisy (lots of false alarms).
  - Or too intrusive (feels like being watched).

Room Companion aims to be the **middle ground**:
- Easy and familiar for residents (feels like talking on the phone).
- Smart enough to notice serious problems.
- Respectful of privacy by default.

## How It Works (Simple View)

### In the Resident’s Room

- Bedside device: tablet + small handset, always powered.
- Resident can:
  - Pick up the handset and ask questions.
  - Press a large "Talk" button and speak.
  - Call for help in natural language ("Help", "I fell", "I need a nurse").
- The device listens like a smart speaker for:
  - Help/distress words.
  - Shouting, crying, loud impacts.

The assistant’s style can be set to:
- **Standard** – normal conversation, gentle reminders.
- **Memory Support** – more repetition and orientation ("You’re in your room at Oakview; it’s time for lunch."), without being condescending.

### For Staff

- Web portal (desktop or tablet) shows:
  - **Alert feed** – emergencies and assistance requests, sorted by urgency.
  - **Resident page** – basic info, mode (Standard/Memory Support), alert history.
- Alerts show **who, where, when, and why** in a short explanation.
- Staff acknowledge and resolve alerts, adding notes when needed.

## Privacy by Design

- **Local-first audio**:
  - Raw audio and full conversations stay on the room device.
- The backend only receives:
  - Alert events (type, time, severity, short explanation).
  - Basic configuration and counts/trends.
- Residents and families get a clear explanation:
  - "It’s here to help you and call staff when needed. It’s not recording everything you say to send to management."

The system has a narrow **emergency override**:
- If it strongly suspects a fall or serious distress, it will alert staff even if the resident didn’t explicitly say "call the nurse".

## Pilot Proposal (Short Version)

- **Where:** One hallway/wing in a single facility.
- **Rooms:** 5–10 resident rooms.
- **Duration:** 6–12 weeks.
- **Hardware:** Tablet + handset per room, using existing Wi‑Fi.
- **Focus:**
  - Help calls and distress detection via audio.
  - Simple resident conversations and reminders.
  - Staff alerting and feedback.

What the facility gets:
- A low-risk way to test whether per-room AI helpers:
  - Improve response to emergencies.
  - Make residents feel safer and more connected.
  - Fit into staff workflows without adding chaos.

## What This Is / What This Is Not

**Is:**
- A support tool for residents and staff.
- A way to catch more "I need help" moments.
- A step toward smarter, more humane monitoring.

**Is not:**
- A replacement for nurse call systems or clinical judgment.
- A hidden camera or always-recording surveillance system.
- A full medical device making diagnoses.

## Vision (Longer Term)

Today: tablet + handset and a web portal.

Over time:
- Custom bedside hardware that looks and feels like a familiar room phone.
- Richer understanding of patterns (sleep, confusion, distress) to support care teams.
- Integrations with existing resident portals and clinical systems.

But the core promise stays the same:

> One helper in every room that listens, speaks kindly, and calls for backup when something seems wrong – without turning elders’ homes into security control rooms.
